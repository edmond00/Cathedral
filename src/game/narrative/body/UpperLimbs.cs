Through these limbs, one shapes the world: wielding tools, grasping weapons, lifting burdens, and engaging in physical contest. They represent humanity's capacity to manipulate reality, to impose order upon chaos through directed strength. In combat, they become extensions of violent intent; in craft, delicate instruments of creation. The upper limbs measure one's ability to exert power, to strike with purpose, and to hold fast against opposing forces.",
