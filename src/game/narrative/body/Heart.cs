        "More than mere muscle pumping blood through vessels, the Heart is the seat of emotion, the wellspring of courage, and the origin of social bonds. It governs not just physical circulation but the circulation of feeling—love and hatred, fear and valor, compassion and cruelty. A strong Heart enables one to face danger without paralysis, to form deep connections with others, to inspire loyalty, and to persevere through emotional turmoil. It is the Heart that compels one toward acts of heroism or recklessness, that drives the formation of alliances, and that determines whether one will stand firm or flee when confronted with moral crisis.",
