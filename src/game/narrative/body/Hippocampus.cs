        "The seahorse-shaped organ of imagination and creative synthesis, where new mental images are conjured from fragments of experience. The hippocampus governs the ability to visualize what is not present, to combine familiar elements into novel configurations, and to generate original ideas. It is the wellspring of creativity—enabling artists to envision their works before creation, inventors to conceive new mechanisms, and dreamers to explore impossible landscapes. A vibrant hippocampus means vivid mental imagery, innovative thinking, and the capacity to imagine alternatives to current reality. It is essential for all creative endeavors, for problem-solving through imaginative leaps, and for the mental construction of hypothetical scenarios.",
