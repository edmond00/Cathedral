The thorax governs breath itself, that most fundamental rhythm upon which consciousness depends. It is through this chamber that voice resonates, carrying words across distances, songs into hearts, and commands into action. The thorax measures one's capacity for sustained exertion, for the oxygen-hungry work of muscle and mind. A strong thorax means endurance in labor, clarity in speech, and the ability to project one's will through the power of voice.",
