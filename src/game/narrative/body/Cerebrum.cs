        "The great folded hemisphere of higher thought, seat of reason and conscious deliberation. The cerebrum is where logic dwells, where abstract concepts are manipulated like chess pieces, where plans are formulated and consequences are predicted. It governs the capacity for rational analysis, strategic thinking, mathematical reasoning, and philosophical contemplation. A powerful cerebrum enables one to solve complex problems, to see patterns in chaos, to construct elaborate schemes, and to understand systems through logical deduction. It is the organ of planning and abstraction, essential for scholars, strategists, and those who would understand the world through the lens of reason rather than instinct or emotion.",
