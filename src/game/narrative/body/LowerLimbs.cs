These pillars of flesh and sinew govern all forms of locomotion—whether sprinting across open terrain, pursuing fleeing quarry, or evading imminent danger. The lower limbs embody the primal instinct of movement, the fundamental choice between advance and retreat, between standing ground and swift escape. Their strength determines how far one may travel, how quickly danger can be fled, and how relentlessly a target may be pursued.",
