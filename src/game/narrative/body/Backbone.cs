The backbone represents more than structural support—it embodies posture, bearing, and composure. A strong backbone enables one to stand tall in the face of adversity, to maintain dignity under pressure, and to project confidence through physical bearing. It is both literal and metaphorical: the anatomical structure that keeps one upright and the inner strength that prevents one from bending to intimidation or collapsing under stress. The backbone measures one's capacity to remain stable, collected, and resolute when circumstances would otherwise cause faltering.",
