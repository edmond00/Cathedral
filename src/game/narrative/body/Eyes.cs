        "Windows to the world and mirrors of the soul, the eyes are organs of perception that transform light into understanding. Through them flows the vast majority of information about the external realm: the recognition of faces, the reading of written words, the tracking of moving targets, and the appreciation of visual beauty. Sharp eyes spot distant movement, discern fine details, read subtle expressions, and aim with precision. They are the primary tools of observation, essential for navigation, for the consumption of written knowledge, for the targeting of projectiles, and for the assessment of situations through visual evidence. The eyes determine how clearly and completely one perceives the visible world.",
