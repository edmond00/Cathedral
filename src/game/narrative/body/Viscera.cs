The viscera represent the body's foundational vitality, its capacity to endure hardship, resist poison, process sustenance, and maintain equilibrium against the assaults of disease and deprivation. Strong viscera grant resilience against toxins, tolerance for harsh conditions, and the stamina to persist when others would falter. They are the silent guardians of bodily integrity, working ceaselessly to maintain the delicate balance upon which life depends.",
