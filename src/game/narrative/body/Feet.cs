The feet govern balance—that crucial sense that prevents tumbling and enables graceful movement across treacherous terrain. They are the organs of grounding, connecting consciousness to the solid world below, and through this connection comes stability of both body and mind. Well-developed feet grant silent movement, the ability to traverse difficult surfaces, and the deep-rooted composure that comes from sure-footedness. They determine whether one walks with thunderous announcement or ghost-like stealth.",
